## Philosophy
- **Config is always preferred to code.** Config is declarative, static, constrained, dependable, migratable.
- **URLs for everything.** Urls are well understood and work. Accessing and manipulating data through a unified URL system means we can take advantage of existing architecture like caching, routing and access control.
- **JSON everywhere.** JSON is the lowest common denominator data format. Embrace it. Everything should read and write pure JSON. An exception being locally executable code.

## TODO
- Type node should depend on schema
- Combine path and editing into cursor
- Optimistic updates...? New array item, cursor shifts to non-existant item

combineLatest as expected
renderLatest like combinelatest but returns react component, optional loading component
