Sandbox for UI experiment

## Philosophy
- **Config is always preferred to code.** Config is declarative & static.
- **URLs for everything.** Urls are well understood and work. Accessing and manipulating data through a unified URL system means we can take advantage of existing architecture like caching, routing and access control.
- **JSON everywhere.** JSON is the lowest common denominator data format. Everything should read and write pure JSON. An exception being locally executable code.
